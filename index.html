    <h4> Challenges </h4>
    <p> I think that my biggest challenge when completing this exercise was adjusting to using a column format. While I am sure that it is extremely helpful once you get used to it, I simply don't feel that I have a strong grasp on ‘skeleton' yet. Additionally, the images also proved to be challenging, as I spent a large amount of time trying different techniques and sizes to make them align the way I wanted them too (while still adjusting size when scaled).</p>
    <p>Oftentimes when working on a project like this I find it difficult to know if I am doing things in the most correct or efficient way possible, or if I end up making more work for myself, or getting the result I am looking for but through means that are not conventional.  Lastly, it took me a while to figure out how important prefixes actually are, and how to use the sites provided to find them.  But despite these challenges, I am still pretty proud of how things turned out.</p>

    <h4> Dreams </h4>
    <p> My dreams for future coding projects?  I would love to learn more about alignment and how to make sure that your elements will always be where you want them to and react the way that you expect them to when scaling and resizing the page.  I feel as though I am making strides towards understanding this, but I am still relatively unconfident.  Additionally, I would love to learn more about fixed headers.  While we did a very basic one here, which I like, I would enjoy learning how to play with the alignment, transparency, and size, as well as how to incorporate icons and logos.</p>
    <p>Finally, I would like to learn how to code a photo slideshow.  This is something that I have tried to accomplish in the past but could never get it to work the way I want it to.  I certainly look forward to continuing to learn and experiment as this class continues.</p>
